Debug Tools for Mod Developers [debugger]
=========================================

This is meant to be a simple tool for developers to use while attempting to debug issues in mods. See below for planned features. This README will be updated as features are added.

Future tools and/or buttons are hidden from the creative inventory by default. To allow access in creative rather than just via `/giveme`, set `not_in_creative` to `0` in the `config.txt`.

### Planned Features
- [x] Meta/Inv Editor
- [ ] Run Lua Code Under Environment (server won't crash)
- [x] In-Game Formspec Editor (doc/form_editor.md)
- [ ] In-Game HUD Editor (?)
<br /> ..and possibly more
